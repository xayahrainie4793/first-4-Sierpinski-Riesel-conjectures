These are the status for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Sierpinski/Riesel conjectures to bases 2 to 64 (except 2, 3, 6, 15, 22, 24, 28, 30, 36, 40, 42, 46, 48, 52, 58, 60, 63 (which have larger conjectured k's)) and bases 100, 128, 256, 512, 1024.

Search limit: 3000 for all (k,b) combo.

Files read as:

* "k,n": the smallest value n such that (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) is (probable) prime.
* "k,NA": (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) possibly has prime, but no (probable) primes of this form are known.
* "k,algebra": (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) proven to be composite for all n (or only be prime for very small n), by all or partial algebraic factors.
* "k,1st/2nd/3rd/4th CK": this k-value is the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th conjectured Sierpinski/Riesel k.
